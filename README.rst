Templates of various utility files
==================================

This repository contains templates of various utility files, like
``setup.py``.  These are things where you normally copy and paste from
other projects, rather than write them from scratch.  So I thought,
instead of having to remember which project had the best one to copy
from, put them all in one place.

These files are designed to have everything I might reasonably need
more than a few times, and links to instructions for the rest.  Most
files are used by copying and removing the unneeded parts.


Python project
--------------

My python project uses these files:
* pyproject.toml (flit)
* github-workflows-pytest.yaml (pytest)
* github-workflows-pyrelease.yaml (Build with Flit and upload to PyPI)
